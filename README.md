# SAMS (School Administration and Management System)

## 🚀 Project Overview

**SAMS** is a comprehensive School Administration and Management System designed to address common efficiency challenges identified within modern high school settings. Developed as a final project for [Insert Course Name/Program, e.g., the Software Engineering Program], the system provides centralized digital tools for administrators and teachers to manage student data, academic results, and attendance with greater ease and accuracy.

## 🎯 Problem & Motivation (Data-Driven Approach)

This project was initiated based on a core data collection phase involving real-world stakeholders. We conducted a detailed survey (using questionnaires and Google Forms) with **School Principals, Sectional Heads, and Teachers**. The insights gathered from these users directly informed the necessary functionality, ensuring SAMS delivers targeted solutions to genuine administrative bottlenecks.

## ✨ Key Features & Functionality (90% Complete)

SAMS is structured around a multi-tiered user environment, currently offering the following major functionalities:

### 1. Centralized Administrative Dashboard (Admin/Principal View)

* **Key Metrics:** Overview of Total Students and Total Staff counts.

* **Performance Monitoring:** Visualization of Grade-wise Average Results (e.g., Grade 6A, 6B, 6C, 7A).

* **Attendance Tracking:** Quick view of the last 5 days of school-wide attendance.

### 2. Core Administration Tools

* **User Management:** Tools for managing and assigning roles to staff and students.

* **Database Management:** Dedicated databases for Student and Teacher records.

* **School-Wide Reporting:** Generation of reports for Attendance and Academic Results.

### 3. Teacher Tools

* **My Classes:** Quick access to assigned classes.

* **Take Attendance:** Streamlined interface for recording daily student attendance.

* **Grade Assignments:** Functionality for submitting and managing grades/results.
